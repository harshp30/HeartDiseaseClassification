# Heart Disease Classification

### Tools/Libraries Used: Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, MatplotLib, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn

A combination of these tools and a Kaggle provided dataset allowed me to create a classification model that helps predict whether a patient has heart disease given certain clinical parameters. (Further details are outlined within the notebook)
